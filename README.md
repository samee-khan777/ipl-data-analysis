# 🏏 IPL Analytics Project (Data Analysis & Visualization)

This project analyzes IPL match and ball-by-ball datasets (`matches.csv` & `deliveries.csv`) to uncover meaningful insights about teams, players, match outcomes, and performance patterns.  
A complete data exploration is performed along with highly unique and modern visualizations (circular charts, funnel diagram, flow charts, polar plots, parallel categories, etc).
